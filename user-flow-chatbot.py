    "we can discuss Newton Laws of Motion"
    "Today Our discussion is on Newton Laws of Motion"

define bot says newtons first 
    "NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION states that An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted on by an unbalanced external force" 


define bot says newton second
    "NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, it is expressed as  F=mâ‹…a. This law explains how the motion of an object changes when a force is applied to it"
   
    
define bot says newton third
    "NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object"
    
define bot says conclusion
    "In CONCLUSION, Newton's Laws of Motion, comprising the principles of inertia, force, and action-reaction, form a fundamental framework for understanding and predicting the motion of objects. These laws remain foundational in classical mechanics, offering practical applications and enduring relevance despite advancements in physics."
